## My Project
This project is a Tetris game with the help of pygame.  
This is one of my first projects and first ever game in python and is strongly inspired from a youtube video because those are my first steps with pygame and even python.  
It is very interesting to look on what python and pygame has to offer.

## Instructions to test the game
- You need to be able to use python
- Copy paste tetris.py into your python file
- create a 'scores.txt' file and write 0 in it and save it (this saves the highscores)
- You then need to install the pygame module in your terminal with:  
```pip install pygame```
- The path to python must work!
- Then just run the file in the terminal an voil√†! You can play Tetris!
